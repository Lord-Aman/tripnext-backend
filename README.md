# TripNext Backend

The **TripNext Backend** is a Node.js-based backend service for managing trips, events, and tasks within the TripNext platform. It provides REST APIs for handling users, trips, events, and to-dos, and is powered by Express.js and MongoDB for efficient data handling and storage.

## Features

- **User Management**: Create and manage user accounts with secure data handling.
- **Trip Management**: Create, update, and delete trips with customizable details like name, destination, and dates.
- **Event Management**: Add and manage events related to specific trips.
- **To-Do Management**: Add, manage, and track to-dos for trips and events.
- **Database Management**: MongoDB is used to persist all user, trip, event, and to-do data.
- **Environment Configuration**: The project uses `dotenv` to manage environment variables securely.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Fast, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user, trip, event, and to-do data.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing middleware.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher.
- **MongoDB**: Installed and running either locally or on a cloud platform like MongoDB Atlas.
- **npm**: Node package manager for installing dependencies.
